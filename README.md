**About the Storyboard:** Here, a user opens the app to find their list of tasks to be completed, where each row in the table view of the Opening Screen represents a task. Tapping on a task brings up the Task Details view. From here, the user can view additional details and select to submit their data for a task by tapping the "Complete Task" button. After providing the requested data, the user presses "Submit Task" and returns to the Opening Screen. At any point, a user can navigate backward to their previous screen by tapping the "Back" arrow in the top left of the app screen.
